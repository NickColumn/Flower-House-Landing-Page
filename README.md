# Flower House Landing Page
My first attempt to create a landing page with only HTML and CSS:

https://nickcolumn.github.io/Flower-House-Landing-Page/

So the idea was to teach myself some HTML + CSS.
In this little landing I wanted to use some of the basics from HTML and CSS, so there is no implementation of Flex, Grids etc, there is no comments or any adaptiveness for now, because it's just a self-education project. 

If you somehow stumbled upon this project - I will gladly accept any criticism and help. Thanks!

PS. The layout was made by my wife for her portfolio: https://www.behance.net/gallery/139649525/Flower-House
